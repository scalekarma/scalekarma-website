[Book a call](#book-a-call)

## Your path to **search&nbsp;visibility** {.section .section_type_highlight}

A modern search stack for your website: from technical foundation to laser-focused
conventional and AI search visibility.

### Site crawling and&nbsp;indexing {.section .section_type_point}

Make your best content discovered by search engines

Your content can’t rank if it’s not found by search engines. On average, over 90% of
web pages fail to receive any organic traffic. We’ll work to fix search visibility
issues throughout your website’s tech stack to help your pages get discovered.

### AI&nbsp;search optimization {.section .section_type_point}

Ensure your brand appears in AI-generated answers

Search engines like Google will lose 25% of their traffic by 2026 due to the rise of
AI-powered search technology. This shift will inevitably impact your website’s search
traffic. Prepare your site and content to thrive in the AI search landscape.

### Structured&nbsp;data markup {.section .section_type_point}

Let search engines freely understand your content

Structured data helps search engines understand your content more quickly and rank it
appropriately. Without it, your site becomes a pile of puzzle pieces without a
guiding picture, taking search engines three times longer to figure out.

### Content strategy {.section .section_type_point}

Rank for all answers to relevant user questions

Using AI agents trained in SEO and Product Marketing, we’ll analyze search intent and
uncover all the best-fit queries related to your offerings, delivering a content
strategy tailored to your unique user journey, from awareness to decision.

### Discovery and strategic alignment {class="numbered--item"}

We start by understanding your business goals, analytics and tech stacks. In two
30-minute calls, we align with your stakeholders on conventional and AI-driven search
strategies. You’ll receive a tailored roadmap with actionable insights, prioritizing
opportunities to scale growth and align marketing, content, and engineering teams for
measurable ROI.

### Analyze and prioritize for impact {.numbered--item}

With your roadmap in hand, we dive into a tailored audit of your search performance.
Instead of overwhelming you with lengthy to-do lists, we identify and prioritize the
5-7 high-impact actions to drive growth and establish a measurement framework to
track progress. This step ensures every effort aligns with your goals and makes
impact visible.

### Turn insights into action {.numbered--item}

We break the audit’s prioritized recommendations into tasks tailored to your team’s
resources and workflow. From developer capacity to content bandwidth, we assign clear
responsibilities and timelines. If needed, our team steps in to bridge gaps, keeping
progress on track and results measurable.

### Ensure actions drive outcomes {.numbered--item}

As key recommendations are implemented, we track progress and adapt to emerging
challenges or opportunities. If needed, we engage additional resources or bring in
specialized expertise. Tailored KPI reporting ensures precise measurement of results,
enabling sustained growth and helping you effectively showcase impact to
stakeholders.
